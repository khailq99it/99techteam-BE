# Problem 4: Three ways to sum to n

This project provides three different JavaScript implementations to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n.

## Implementations

*   **sum\_to\_n\_a(n):** Uses a loop to calculate the sum. Time complexity: O(n).
*   **sum\_to\_n\_b(n):** Uses recursion to calculate the sum. Time complexity: O(n).
*   **sum\_to\_n\_c(n):** Uses the arithmetic progression formula to calculate the sum. Time complexity: O(1).

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd Problem-04`
3.  Install dependencies: `yarn install`

## Running the program

To run the program, use the following command:
